# Flight-Ticket
This Java program calculates the fare for a journey based on the distance, age, and type of journey (one-way or round trip) entered by the user. It applies different discounts based on the age and journey type to calculate the final fare.


The program applies the following rules for fare calculation:

- For one-way journeys:
- If the age is below 12, a 50% discount is applied.
- If the age is between 12 and 24, a 10% discount is applied.
- If the age is between 24 and 65, no discount is applied.
- If the age is 65 or above, a 30% discount is applied.
- For round trip journeys:
- The same age-based discounts as above are applied.
- Additionally, a 20% round trip discount is applied.
